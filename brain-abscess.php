                                        <p class="mb-0">A brain abscess is a serious, life-threatening condition caused by a localized collection of pus within the brain tissue due to an infection. It usually results from bacteria, fungi, or parasites entering the brain through the bloodstream, direct trauma, or infections from nearby structures like the ears, sinuses, or teeth. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, a brain abscess can lead to increased pressure in the skull, severe neurological complications, or even death. Early recognition and medical intervention are crucial for a successful outcome.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The symptoms of a brain abscess can develop gradually or suddenly, depending on the severity of the infection. Common signs include severe headaches, fever, nausea, vomiting, confusion, seizures, weakness, and difficulty speaking or moving certain body parts. If the abscess grows, it can increase intracranial pressure, leading to loss of consciousness or coma. Individuals with weakened immune systems, chronic sinus or ear infections, congenital heart disease, recent neurosurgery, or head trauma are at a higher risk of developing a brain abscess.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Dr. Kunal Kumar, a skilled neurosurgeon, uses CT scans, MRI, and blood tests to diagnose brain abscesses and determine their size and location. Treatment involves a combination of antibiotics or antifungal medications to fight the infection. In cases where the abscess is large or causing pressure on the brain, surgical drainage or aspiration may be necessary to remove the pus and relieve symptoms. In some cases, minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques can effectively treat the abscess while minimizing risks.</p>
