                                        <p class="mb-0">Dr. Kunal Kumar is a highly skilled and experienced medical professional specializing in the treatment and management of Hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus, often referred to as "water on the brain," is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, leading to increased pressure. This condition can occur at any age and can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired due to injury, infection, or other medical conditions. Dr. Kumar has extensive knowledge in diagnosing and treating this complex condition, ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate care.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Dr. Kumar employs advanced diagnostic techniques to accurately assess the severity and impact of Hydrocephalus. Using imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans, he can evaluate the structure of the brain and identify areas where fluid buildup occurs. Based on these results, he formulates a personalized treatment plan, which may include surgical interventions such as the insertion of a shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). These procedures aim to divert excess fluid and relieve pressure on the brain, improving symptoms and enhancing the quality of life for patients.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">As a compassionate healthcare provider, Dr. Kunal Kumar works closely with patients and their families to explain the condition, treatment options, and potential outcomes. He understands the emotional and psychological challenges that come with dealing with a neurological disorder like Hydrocephalus, and he offers a supportive environment to address concerns and provide reassurance. His approach to treatment is patient-centered, focusing on the well-being and long-term health of each individual.</p>
