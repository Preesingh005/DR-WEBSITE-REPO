                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Spinal dysraphism is a broad term for a group of congenital (birth-related) spinal cord and vertebral abnormalities caused by improper neural tube closure during fetal development. These defects can range from mild to severe and may involve the spinal cord, meninges, and vertebrae. Spinal dysraphism includes conditions like spina bifida, tethered cord syndrome, and lipomyelomeningocele, which can lead to neurological complications if left untreated. Some cases are externally visible at birth, while others may be diagnosed later due to symptoms such as back pain, weakness, or bladder dysfunction.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">There are two primary types of spinal dysraphism: open and closed. Open spinal dysraphism, such as myelomeningocele, is a severe form where spinal nerves are exposed outside the body, leading to significant neurological deficits. Closed spinal dysraphism, including lipomas or fatty tumors on the spinal cord, may have less obvious symptoms but can still cause issues like leg weakness, scoliosis, bladder/bowel dysfunction, and chronic pain. Symptoms may vary based on the severity of the defect and the level of spinal cord involvement.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management. Dr. Kunal Kumar, a spine specialist, uses MRI, ultrasound, and CT scans to evaluate spinal dysraphism and determine the best treatment plan. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Mild cases may require only observation and physical therapy, while severe cases often need surgical intervention to release a tethered spinal cord, remove lipomas, or correct spinal deformities. Minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques help improve outcomes, reduce complications, and prevent further neurological damage.</p>
