                                           <h3>Head Injury</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">A head injury refers to any trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain, ranging from mild concussions to severe brain damage. These injuries can occur due to falls, road accidents, sports injuries, or violent impacts. Head injuries are classified as closed (when the skull remains intact) or penetrating (when an object pierces the skull and enters the brain tissue). The severity of a head injury can vary, with mild cases causing temporary symptoms and severe cases leading to long-term neurological complications or life-threatening conditions.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The symptoms of a head injury depend on its severity. Mild head injuries, such as concussions, may cause headaches, dizziness, confusion, nausea, and brief memory loss. Moderate to severe head injuries can lead to loss of consciousness, seizures, slurred speech, persistent vomiting, vision problems, and difficulty in movement. In severe cases, head trauma can cause internal bleeding (hematoma), brain swelling, or skull fractures, leading to long-term cognitive and motor impairments. Immediate medical attention is crucial to prevent complications like permanent brain damage or coma.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Dr. Kunal Kumar, an experienced neurosurgeon, evaluates head injuries using advanced imaging techniques like CT scans and MRI to assess the extent of brain damage. Mild cases may only require rest, pain relievers, and close monitoring. However, severe cases often require surgical intervention to remove blood clots, relieve pressure on the brain, or repair skull fractures. Critical care, including oxygen therapy and medications to control brain swelling, is also essential for recovery. Prompt treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes and prevent long-term complications.</p>
