                                           <h3>Headache</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Headaches are one of the most common medical complaints, affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. They can range from mild and occasional to severe and chronic, and they may be caused by a variety of factors. Common types of headaches include tension headaches, migraines, cluster headaches, and sinus headaches. Tension headaches are often linked to stress, muscle strain, or poor posture, while migraines are typically more intense, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light. Cluster headaches, though rare, cause excruciating pain on one side of the head, often around the eye. Sinus headaches are caused by inflammation or infection in the sinus cavities.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The exact cause of a headache can be difficult to pinpoint, as it can stem from a range of underlying factors. These may include lifestyle habits such as lack of sleep, dehydration, or poor diet, as well as environmental triggers like bright lights, strong odors, or weather changes. Headaches can also be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, including hormonal changes, eye strain, stress, or more serious issues like brain tumors or aneurysms. Identifying the type and cause of a headache is crucial for determining the most effective treatment plan.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Treatment for headaches depends on the severity, frequency, and type of headache a person is experiencing. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be effective for mild headaches. For more severe or chronic headaches, doctors may recommend prescription medications or preventive treatments such as triptans, beta-blockers, or anticonvulsants. Lifestyle modifications, including stress management techniques, regular exercise, and better sleep hygiene, can also be helpful in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches. For people who suffer from migraines or cluster headaches, it is essential to work with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized management plan.</p>
