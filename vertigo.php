                                           <h3>Vertigo</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Vertigo is a medical condition characterized by a false sensation of spinning or movement, often making individuals feel as though they or their surroundings are in motion. Unlike dizziness, which is a general feeling of lightheadedness or unsteadiness, vertigo is specifically a sensation of rotational movement. It can be triggered by various factors, including inner ear problems, vestibular disorders, or neurological conditions. The most common causes of vertigo include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere’s disease, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. BPPV, for example, occurs when tiny calcium particles in the inner ear become dislodged and disrupt normal balance signals.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The symptoms of vertigo can be distressing and include a spinning sensation, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty maintaining balance. These symptoms may occur suddenly or be triggered by head movements, changes in position, or exposure to certain environments. In some cases, vertigo can be associated with additional symptoms such as hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), or a feeling of fullness in the ear, especially in conditions like Meniere’s disease. The duration of vertigo episodes can vary from a few seconds to several minutes or longer, depending on the underlying cause.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Diagnosing vertigo involves a thorough evaluation of a patient’s medical history, symptoms, and physical examination. Doctors may perform specific tests, such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver or head impulse test, to identify the cause of vertigo and determine the appropriate treatment. In some cases, imaging studies like MRI or CT scans may be recommended to rule out other serious conditions, such as stroke or brain tumors. Identifying the underlying cause of vertigo is crucial for effective treatment and management.</p>
