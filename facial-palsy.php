                                           <h3>Facial Palsy</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Facial palsy refers to the weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face, causing a drooping or loss of facial expression. It typically occurs when the facial nerve, which controls the muscles responsible for facial movements, becomes damaged or compromised. The most common form of facial palsy is Bell's palsy, a condition of unknown cause that leads to sudden, temporary facial weakness. Other causes can include trauma, infections, tumors, stroke, or neurological diseases. Regardless of the cause, facial palsy can significantly impact a person's ability to express emotions, speak clearly, or perform routine activities such as eating and drinking.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The symptoms of facial palsy can vary, but they typically include a drooping of one side of the face, difficulty closing the eye on the affected side, an asymmetrical smile, and a loss of taste in the front of the tongue. In some cases, individuals may experience pain or discomfort around the jaw or behind the ear on the affected side. While facial palsy can be alarming and distressing, it is important to note that many cases, such as Bell's palsy, improve over time with appropriate treatment. However, recovery can take weeks or even months, and some individuals may experience lingering facial weakness or asymmetry.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Diagnosing facial palsy involves a thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider, including a physical examination and review of the patientâ€™s medical history. In certain cases, additional tests such as MRI or CT scans may be recommended to identify underlying causes, such as tumors, infections, or stroke. It is essential to rule out these potential causes, as they may require more specific treatments. Early diagnosis can help determine the best course of action and improve the chances of a full recovery.</p>
