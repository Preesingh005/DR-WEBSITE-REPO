                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Aneurysms and arteriovenous (AV) malformations are serious neurological conditions that can significantly affect a personâ€™s health if left untreated. An aneurysm occurs when there is a bulging or ballooning in the blood vessels, typically in the brain, due to weakened vessel walls. This can lead to a rupture, causing bleeding within the brain, which may result in a stroke, brain damage, or even death. On the other hand, AV malformations are abnormal tangles of blood vessels where arteries and veins are directly connected, bypassing the capillary system. This leads to irregular blood flow, and in some cases, can cause hemorrhages, seizures, or neurological deficits.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The symptoms of aneurysms and AV malformations can be subtle or sudden, depending on the severity and location of the condition. Common signs include severe headaches, vision problems, seizures, and even loss of motor function or speech. However, some individuals may experience no symptoms at all until a rupture or significant event occurs. Diagnosing these conditions often involves advanced imaging techniques like CT scans, MRIs, or angiograms, which help medical professionals determine the exact nature, size, and location of the aneurysm or AV malformation.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Treatment for aneurysms and AV malformations depends on factors such as the size, location, and risk of rupture. For aneurysms, surgical interventions like clipping or coiling may be necessary to prevent rupture, while AV malformations may require endovascular embolization or surgical resection. Both conditions require careful monitoring and management to reduce the risk of complications. Neurosurgeons and interventional specialists work together to offer a personalized treatment plan for each patient, focusing on minimizing the risk and improving outcomes. With timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment, individuals with aneurysms or AV malformations can manage the condition and lead healthy lives.</p>
