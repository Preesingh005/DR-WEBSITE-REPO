                                           <h3>Spine Tumor</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">A spine tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within or around the spinal cord and vertebrae. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and may originate in the spine (primary tumors) or spread from other parts of the body (secondary or metastatic tumors). Spine tumors can lead to severe pain, neurological deficits, and even paralysis if not diagnosed and treated in time. Common symptoms include persistent back pain, weakness in the limbs, numbness, loss of balance, and difficulty walking. If the tumor compresses the spinal cord or nerves, it can lead to bladder or bowel dysfunction.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Early detection of spine tumors is crucial for effective treatment. Dr. Kunal Kumar, an experienced neurosurgeon specializing in spine disorders, conducts a thorough clinical examination and diagnostic imaging to assess the tumor’s location and severity. Tests such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), CT scans, and biopsies help determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant. Understanding the tumor’s characteristics allows for a personalized treatment approach, ensuring the best possible outcomes for patients.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The treatment for spine tumors depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Non-surgical options include radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which are often used for malignant tumors or when surgery is not an option. For benign and operable tumors, minimally invasive spine surgery or microsurgical tumor excision can be performed to remove the tumor while preserving spinal function. Dr. Kunal Kumar specializes in advanced surgical techniques that minimize damage to surrounding tissues and speed up recovery. In some cases, spinal stabilization or fusion may be necessary to maintain spinal integrity after tumor removal.</p>
