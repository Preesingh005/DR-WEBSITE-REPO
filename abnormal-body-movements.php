                                           <h3>Abnormal body movements</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Abnormal body movements refer to involuntary or uncontrollable movements that deviate from typical motor control and can affect various parts of the body. These movements may include tremors, twitches, jerking, shaking, or other types of dyskinesia that occur without conscious effort. The underlying causes of abnormal body movements can be wide-ranging, from neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or multiple sclerosis, to side effects of medications, metabolic imbalances, or even psychological conditions such as anxiety or stress. The presence of abnormal movements can impact a person's ability to perform everyday tasks, often leading to physical and emotional challenges.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">One of the most common forms of abnormal body movements is tremors, which typically involve rhythmic shaking, often in the hands or head. Tremors can be caused by various conditions, including Parkinson's disease, where the brain’s ability to regulate movement is impaired. Another condition, called dystonia, is characterized by muscle contractions that cause twisting, repetitive movements, or abnormal postures. In Huntington's disease, patients may exhibit jerky, random movements known as chorea. These movements can be highly disruptive and affect a person’s ability to maintain posture, speak clearly, or engage in normal physical activities.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Diagnosing the cause of abnormal body movements requires a comprehensive medical evaluation. Physicians typically begin with a detailed medical history and physical examination to identify the nature of the movements and any potential underlying conditions. In many cases, further diagnostic tests such as blood tests, MRI scans, or electromyography (EMG) may be necessary to assess neurological function or detect structural abnormalities in the brain or nervous system. The evaluation process is crucial in differentiating between neurological disorders, medication side effects, or other causes that may contribute to the abnormal movements.</p>
