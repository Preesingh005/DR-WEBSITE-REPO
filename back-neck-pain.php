                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Back pain and neck pain are among the most common musculoskeletal issues affecting people of all ages. These conditions can range from mild discomfort to chronic pain that interferes with daily activities. Back pain often affects the lower back (lumbar region), while neck pain is centered around the cervical spine. Both conditions can result from poor posture, muscle strain, injury, or underlying spinal disorders such as herniated discs, arthritis, or nerve compression.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The treatment for back and neck pain depends on the severity and underlying cause. Non-surgical treatments include pain relief medications, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy to improve mobility and strengthen spinal muscles. Chiropractic adjustments, acupuncture, and massage therapy can also provide relief. For severe cases, minimally invasive procedures, such as epidural injections or spine surgery, may be required to address conditions like nerve compression or disc herniation.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Preventing back and neck pain involves maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, proper posture, and ergonomic adjustments. Strengthening core and neck muscles through stretching exercises can reduce strain on the spine. Avoiding prolonged sitting, using supportive chairs, and maintaining a proper sleeping position with a supportive pillow can significantly lower the risk of pain. With the right care and proactive lifestyle changes, individuals can prevent chronic pain and maintain a strong, pain-free spine.</p>
