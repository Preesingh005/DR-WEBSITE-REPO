                                           <h3>Brain Tumor</h3>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="mb-0">A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within or near the brain. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and may originate in the brain (primary tumors) or spread from other parts of the body (secondary or metastatic tumors). Brain tumors can affect brain function by pressing on surrounding tissues, increasing pressure inside the skull, and disrupting normal neurological processes. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent serious complications and improve patient outcomes.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">The symptoms of a brain tumor vary depending on its size, location, and growth rate. Common signs include persistent headaches, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, seizures, difficulty speaking, memory loss, and changes in personality or behavior. Some tumors may also cause weakness or numbness in certain parts of the body. The exact cause of brain tumors is still unknown, but risk factors may include genetic mutations, exposure to radiation, a family history of brain tumors, and certain environmental factors</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">Dr. Kunal Kumar, an experienced neurosurgeon, diagnoses brain tumors using MRI, CT scans, and biopsies to assess the tumor's location and severity. Treatment depends on the type and stage of the tumor. Non-surgical options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug treatments to slow tumor growth. Surgical intervention, such as tumor excision or minimally invasive neurosurgery, is often performed to remove or reduce the tumor while preserving brain function. Advanced techniques, like stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife), offer non-invasive alternatives for treating small or inoperable tumors.</p>
